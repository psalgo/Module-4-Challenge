Charter schools performed better than district schools in both math and reading. The average scores in those two subjects were higher than those in district schools. It appears that charter schools tend to have higher academic performances. Higher spending, however, didn\'92t necessarily correlate with better performance. Perhaps more money doesn\'92t equate to higher academic performance. The school environment might more positively impact academic performance instead of increased spending per student. }
